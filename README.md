# x86-64-assembly
This repository contains my practice solutions to some of the exercises
in Ray Seyfarth's book "Introduction to 64 Bit Assembly Programming for
Linux and OS X".

In many of the exercises, I copied the text of the exercise from Dr. Seyfarth's
book.  Credit for that text goes to him; any errors are my own.

Please don't use these to cheat -- I can't claim that these solutions are
"good" or "accurate".
